I tried to learn JS for youtube SuperSimpleDev.
I almost watched the whole video, except 2 parts. one that relates
the testing with jasmine and the other that is related to the 
backend.
I believe I know the main part of the JS and I am ready for doing projects
and when I became proficeint I and want to learn a framwork like react, I can watch
the dropped parts, I think In that situation, I will learn better.
bis bald!
